Patient: My son is 3 years and 4 months old, and he often experiences frequent nosebleeds. He has a tendency to get angry easily and has been staying in an air-conditioned environment for a long time. Sometimes he wakes up with a runny nose and sneezes multiple times, and scratches his eyes and nose. Occasionally, he wakes up with nosebleeds, and the blood is sometimes brown and sometimes bright red, and the frequency varies. Last year in July, he underwent a nasal endoscopy and blood tests, and all the results were normal. The doctor found that his nasal mucosa was slightly damaged (because he had just experienced a nosebleed at that time), and advised him to keep the air humid. In March this year, he went to see the doctor again, and the doctor said that his nasal cavity is relatively dry. Because he drank a lot of nourishing soup in June and July, he often had nosebleeds. Last week, he went to the hospital for a check-up, and the report is as shown. The doctor said it's allergic rhinitis, and he needs to undergo desensitization treatment after he turns 4 years old. The treatment needs to be taken for two to three years, and the cure rate is 70-80%. Doctor, do you think this is allergic rhinitis? Does his age meet the conditions for desensitization treatment?

She eats her supplementary foods normally, but doesn't seem to be in any distress.

Do we need to go to the hospital? \n\nBy the way, she had a bronchopneumonia when she was 2 months old, and it was also a week of coughing, then suddenly a fever. Since she was too young, we took her to the hospital directly, and the doctor diagnosed her with pneumonia after a check-up and imaging. I'm worried about this time because both times she coughed for a week and then got a fever, but there were no other symptoms.

Patient: Doctor, my baby was born on February 18th, and is now almost 5 months old. She has been formula-fed since birth, and had severe diarrhea when she was around 20 days old. The doctor prescribed probiotics, and I gave her bifidobacterium and later, after switching to formula, she had diarrhea again. I then started her on probiotics again and her diarrhea went away. I kept her on probiotics for a month, then switched back to regular formula, but she had diarrhea again. So I switched her back to probiotics and her diarrhea went away, but she has had green stools ever since. Recently, her stools turned yellow-green. The doctor said it might be due to high iron content in the formula, but there's no big issue. For two months, she hasn't had diarrhea again. Her height and weight are normal. On the 6th, she had diarrhea at 4am, and her stools were not very watery, but lighter than usual. I gave her probiotics and the next day she had two normal bowel movements, so I stopped giving her probiotics. But on the 8th, she had diarrhea again at 1am, so I started giving her probiotics again, and on the 9th, she had one normal bowel movement. I've been giving her probiotics continuously. This morning, at 4am, she had diarrhea again. She's been fine, with normal milk intake, and has been eating an extra meal. Normally, she has 5 feedings a day, each 150ml. I'm not sure if it's because of the air conditioner, as she's very sensitive to the cold. At night, we have to cover her with a thin blanket, and she sweats a lot on her head and neck. She occasionally coughs a couple of times, and I'm not sure if it's because of spit-up.\nDoctor: Is your baby fussy right now?\nPatient: The baby is fussy.\nDoctor: Has your baby been vomiting?\nPatient: We have found that the baby indeed had vomiting.\n	Pediatric Diarrhea	train

Patient: Hello, doctor, my baby is six months old and is fed a mixed diet. In Beijing, he was constipated, and I thought it was because he wasn't drinking enough water. He doesn't like to drink water, and I have to coax and deceive him to drink about 20ml each time. When we returned to Xinjiang from Beijing on June 1st, we planned to stay for a month.

After passing a hard stool at 3 am using a suppository, he would only eat a little milk. However, he vomited again 30 minutes later. We went to the emergency room at 4 am, and the doctor said it was a gut bacterial infection. We were given an anti-emetic injection and prescribed cefixime and bifidobacterium bifidum capsules. He no longer vomits and can eat. He has a fever of 37.5 degrees for a day and a half, and his bowel movements have increased from once a day to twice a day for the past two days.

Patient: Doctor, I'm glad to see you. My daughter is 36 months old and has been experiencing the following symptoms since she recovered from a cold on October 20th. She has been constantly runny nose (clear watery discharge, no sense of it coming out, but sometimes yellow and sticky discharge comes out when she wakes up, and I can see some nasal mucus when I look into her nose, but not much), cough (coughs during exercise, before sleep, and when her nose is congested at night, but mostly doesn't cough in the morning or other times), nasal congestion (gets congested when it's cold, feels congested after kicking the blanket at night, and can hear nasal sounds), and heavy breathing (with a snoring sound). She doesn't have a fever and has a good appetite and overall condition. She drank a fish soup decoction for 5 days in mid-November (one small bowl each day). She hasn't taken any medication, and I've been using saline spray to help her breathe and using a nasal aspirator to suck out the nasal mucus, but she's not able to blow her nose yet. I'm not sure if it's a nasal infection or if the cough is caused by the nasal infection.

Patient: Doctor, hello. Our 2-year-old boy started having a fever on the evening of the 18th and it's been continuous. He was diagnosed with moderate pneumonia on the 22nd after a chest X-ray. After being given IV fluids for 4 days, the fever went away the next day and the pneumonia was almost fully recovered. The doctor asked us to go home for rest, but that night, he started coughing and had a fever again. He went to the hospital the next day (the 26th) and the doctor said it might be a secondary infection, so we were prescribed 2 more days of fluids, and this time we switched from Azithromycin to Ceftriaxone. However, the fever hasn't gone away and he's been feeling unwell since the 26th. He was given a blood test on the 26th and there are no abnormal symptoms.

Patient: Hello, Doctor. My baby is 11 months and 6 months old. At the age of 4 months, she had viral gastroenteritis and had diarrhea for 2 months, with a frequency of 2-3 times a day, and the stool was yellow and frothy. After visiting several doctors and taking traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, she finally recovered, but I'm not sure what the Western medicine was.\n\nShe had taken many medications, including digestive enzymes, probiotics, and antibiotics, such as fluconazole, and a vaccine against viral diseases. I also gave her shots of antiviral medication, which I think was balm.\n\nAfter she recovered, her stool changed, and we did a stool test, which showed positive for rotavirus. The doctor said it might be an antibody reaction. After that, I didn't take her to the doctor again, and we didn't give her any probiotics to regulate her digestive system.\n\nSince then, she has had frequent diarrhea, which would happen whenever she wasn't careful. She would have dry, hard stools after eating, followed by loose stools. This pattern has been consistent for a while.\n\nOn May 21st, she had diarrhea again, and I gave her traditional Chinese medicine, which caused a rash on her body, resembling mosquito bites. After stopping the medicine, she was fine, but her belly was bloated. The doctor at the clinic said it was eczema and that the bloated belly was due to indigestion.\n\nOn May 23rd, she had a cold, and I gave her medication, which caused her to have diarrhea again, with 4 episodes in one day. The stool was dark brown and contained mucus-like substances.

Patient: Hello, the baby is 6.5 months old, female, full-term, mixed feeding, and in good health, weighing around 17 kilograms. She started having nasal congestion at 5.5 months old, without fever or cold symptoms. At night, she wakes up with difficulty breathing, but it improves when she is held or fed. There's no nasal discharge, and using salt water to clean her nose doesn't reveal any nasal mucus. She has never had nasal congestion or a cold before, and hasn't been exposed to allergens or temperature changes. 20 days later, around a week ago, she started having clear nasal discharge, but it hasn't caused her to catch a cold. The discharge has increased slightly over the past few days, and has become a bit sticky. Recently, she has been experiencing difficulty breathing while feeding, and her breathing sounds like "hss" is more noticeable. I wonder if it's due to incomplete nasal development in infants? Are there any ways to improve it? If the nasal congestion persists for a month, will it lead to conditions like rhinitis? The increased nasal discharge over the past week is it due to catching a cold or the nasal congestion itself? Do I need to have her medically examined?

Patient: Doctor, my child is 2 years old. Last night, they ate a lot for dinner. When they went to sleep, they felt like the food wasn't digested, felt like food was rising up, wanted to vomit but didn't. I gave them Mumei Ai and Waking Qi Yang Er granules to massage their belly clockwise, and it got better. The next day, they felt quite good and normal, but ate less. After lunch, when they took a nap, they felt like vomiting again, and the food wasn't digested, rising up, and they were uncomfortable. They swallowed it down but woke up and vomited, throwing up everything they ate. From 6 pm onwards, they frequently vomited, and I gave them half a Pan Li Ketone tablet. The first time they took it, they vomited, but after taking another half, they ate it down. However, the vomiting didn't stop immediately. I gave them Waking Qi Yang Er granules and Mumei Ai, but they were vomited out again! After 9 pm, the vomiting frequency decreased, and by 11 pm, they stopped vomiting. I gave them some water, and family members gave them sugar water and salt water, and they didn't vomit again. Then they started having diarrhea, possibly 4-5 times. I'm not sure if it's because of the sugar water. The child didn't sleep well last night, with the best sleep only 2 hours, and then they were restless. Their body temperature was 37.8°C. At 6 am, they vomited again, and at 7 am, I gave them another half a Lan Li Ketone tablet, Waking Qi, and Mumei Ai. Half an hour later, I gave them 100ml of milk, and they slept for about 2 hours and then vomited again, and had a bowel movement.

Patient: Hello doctor, my baby is 9 months old, had diarrhea for a week, 4-5 times a day, with mucus and sometimes loose stool.

Patient: Hello, Dr. Cui, my son is 2 years and 1 month old. He started having runny nose and occasional cough on the 20th. I took him to the hospital on the 21st and he had phlegm in his airway, so the doctor prescribed medicine for 3 days. After taking the medicine, his condition didn't improve, so I went back to the hospital and got another prescription for 3 more days of medicine. On the 25th night, his cough got worse and his runny nose didn't stop. Although he didn't have a fever, I changed doctors and did a saliva test, which showed that he had a mycoplasma infection. The new doctor prescribed azithromycin and some other medicine. I gave him all the medicine last night, but he had a fever of 38.7 at midnight, so I gave him paracetamol and his fever went down the next morning. The doctor said that mycoplasma infection is hard to recover from and if his condition doesn't improve after 3 days of medicine, he needs to get a shot. His appetite is also not good and his bowel movement was a bit loose yesterday night. I hope you can respond. Thank you.\nDoctor: Does your baby have any symptoms of lung shadows?\nPatient: Yes, the baby has symptoms of lung shadow.\n	Pneumonia	train

Patient: The child is 11 months old, weighing 8 kg. Doctor, I have asked you questions about my baby's diarrhea issue before. At 6 months old, she had diarrhea for a month and didn't improve. After examination, it was found that she had a mild allergy to beef and a moderate allergy to milk, but after adjusting her diet for a while, she showed some improvement. However, she still has frequent diarrhea (sometimes with small black particles in the stool, as shown in the picture), and then takes Montmorillonite powder and probiotics to alleviate the symptoms. After taking the medicine for a few days, she improves, but the symptoms recur after the medicine is stopped, and she also takes zinc supplements. However, her bowel movements are irregular, sometimes 3 times a day, and sometimes only 1 time. She doesn't eat solid food well, only breastfeeds, and refuses to eat solid food even when hungry, but often bites trash (paper towels, plastic, etc.). On May 13th, she had diarrhea 8 times, and the stool examination on the next day was normal.

Patient: Doctor, today is the fourth day of the child's hospitalization. I visited in the morning, only for a few minutes, the attending doctor said that the child did not have a fever yesterday, but still didn't feel well. The pediatric ICU has formula milk, but the child doesn't want to drink it (she never drank formula milk, and after being weaned at 1.5 years old, she drinks only adult cow's milk). She drinks a little water. When I saw her, she was lying on her side sleeping, with a breathing machine and an IV drip. The doctor told her mother that her mother had come, so he removed the breathing mask, looked at me, and cried a few times, but the crying wasn't too loud, then went back to sleep on her side. I don't know if it's the effect of the medicine or lack of spirit. When I saw her in this state, my heart was shattered, I wish I was the one who was sick instead. The attending doctor told me that a lumbar puncture was done, and the cerebrospinal fluid was normal, but it's still possible that something could happen in the future. The past few days have been just taking blood and having X-rays and other tests, a small cold, how could it lead to such a serious situation? Even if it's pneumonia, it shouldn't have caused such a big impact. Doctor, I'm sending you the list of what happened over the past few days, please help me analyze it. I can only send 9 pictures, and 2 more can't be sent, I took them in the order of the child's hospitalization dates, please help me analyze them.\n	Pneumonia	train

Today is the 3rd day of hospitalization, and since yesterday, the fever has subsided, and for the past 24 hours, there has been no fever, but occasional cough (coughing 2-3 times, with sputum, but not vomiting, and occasionally dysphagia), no dyspnea, and the highest respiratory rate at night is 36 times per minute, with good mental status. The CT results just came out, and the doctor said there is a blockage in the upper right lung, and there are lung sounds on auscultation, and it's recommended to do a bronchoscopy for flushing. If bronchoscopy is not done, it will be necessary to stay in the hospital for 2-3 weeks for antibiotic infusion treatment. My questions are: can the diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia and atelectasis be confirmed by checking the examination report? Is it necessary to do bronchoscopy for flushing? What is the current treatment plan, and is it necessary to stay in the hospital for 2-3 weeks for antibiotic infusion? Are the long-term side effects of antibiotic infusion greater than those of bronchoscopy? I'm extremely anxious and look forward to your reply, thank you very much!

Patient: Doctor, my daughter is 2 years and 1 month old. About two weeks ago, she had a fever of 39.4°C, but she was fine during the day, so we didn't give her any medicine.

About a week ago, her sputum production increased, but since she doesn't know how to cough up sputum, she would sometimes vomit up mucus. Her nasal discharge has also increased, and it's changed from clear to a yellowish-green color. It was then that we suspected a bacterial infection and took her to the hospital.

Patient: Hello, my child was born in December 2016 and is now 13 months old. They had coughed occasionally from mid-November to mid-December, and also had dry itchy rashes on the outer side of their legs and buttocks. From 8 to 12 months old, the child would often scratch the rashes on their legs and buttocks and would often break the skin. At the 1-year-old routine physical examination in mid-December, the doctor suspected that these symptoms might be due to an allergy, and checked for allergens. The child was found to be allergic to wheat, eggs, milk, soybeans, tomatoes, and cod. The doctor prescribed a one-week course of chlorpheniramine syrup, and we avoided giving the child the allergenic foods. During the medication period, the child's dry rashes improved (we also reduced bathing and applied moisturizing cream), and the cough also stopped. After stopping the medication, the child got a cold and it's hard to tell whether it's a cold or an allergic cough. I haven't given the child any of the six known allergens, and I'm breastfeeding, so I also avoided them. Yesterday, the child had a severe cough at night, and this morning they had a runny nose and tears.\nDoctor: Does your child have any allergies?\nPatient: The child has an allergy.\nDoctor: Does your child cough up phlegm?\nPatient: Not\n	Allergic sinusitis	train

Patient: My 2-year-old daughter started vomiting and fever since last Tuesday. Her highest body temperature was 38.5 degrees Celsius.

Patient: The patient is 13 years and a half old boy. He has been allergic since childhood. He suffered from asthma attacks a few times before he was 5 years old, and then developed rhinitis around 5-6 years old. This condition has worsened over the past 6-7 years. He has been seeing doctors for this problem, both traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, and has tried many medications. Some of the medications worked at first, but later lost their effectiveness. \n\nIn July last year, he visited a director at the Nanjing Children's Hospital. At that time, his lung function was normal, but his nitric oxide level was 109. The director prescribed 4 medications, including 1 tablet of fexofenadine, 1 tablet of mometasone, inhalation of fluticasone, and spray of azelastine (used morning and night). By October, his symptoms improved, and his nitric oxide level dropped to 63. By February this year, it dropped to 25, a bit higher. The doctor told him to switch from fluticasone to budesonide, 2 times a day, and to stop fexofenadine. \n\nHowever, in May, after a 2-day viral fever, he started to develop runny nose and itching on his back, which the doctor said was due to allergy. The doctor prescribed a package of desloratadine. I am not sure if the change was sudden, as the doctor seemed to be unclear when answering questions. It was only after I asked her again that she said he didn't need to adjust the medication. He has been taking medication for almost a year now, and the side effects are a concern. The doctor's attitude also worries me. I fear that changing medications may not be done in a scientific way and may affect his health.\n	Allergic sinusitis	train

However, he doesn't eat much supplementary food lately, and breast milk is about three times a day, both during the day and at night, as he has difficulty sleeping and wakes up often due to discomfort in his stomach. If he can pass gas, he can go back to sleep, otherwise, he cries and wants to be breastfed to soothe him. \n\nWhen he was six months old, his vitamin D deficiency was severe, and after taking 800 units for two months, there was no obvious effect, so we increased it to 1200 units. His longest sleep is now two hours, and he wakes up every half hour, with the longest being one hour. \n\nI would like to ask: 1. Is his slow growth due to my feeding method? If so, how can I adjust it? I've been worried about his growth for half a year now. 2. Should I wean him off breast milk and give him formula milk instead? 3. Do you think his sleep problem is related to his severe vitamin D deficiency? I think he wakes up each time because he's being held back by gas, or is it possible that his gut microbiota imbalance due to previous diarrhea is the cause? The probiotics didn't seem to have any effect. The growth chart shows that at nine months, his weight hasn't changed, and his height has only increased by 1 cm.\n	Pediatric Diarrhea	train

Patient: The baby is 1 year and 1 month old. Recently, within a week, she started having bowel movements after eating. On the first day, she had 5 bowel movements, all of which were soft and mushy, but the last one had a watery separation. The next day, she started eating a mixture of apples, carrots, and rice cereal. After taking the probiotics from Lifespace, her bowel movements changed to 3 times a day, usually in the morning, afternoon, and evening, and the stool became soft. However, after eating milk and supplementary food, she would usually have a bowel movement after playing for a while. In the past two days, she ate a mixture of pumpkin, carrots, and rice cereal twice a day, and drank 4-5 times milk, with a total of 180ml. When her stool was slightly loose, we took her to the doctor and tested for bacterial infections, but only found food residue.

Patient: A 3-year-old and 4-month-old boy has been experiencing clear nasal discharge since the beginning of last year or early winter. It seems to get better after activity, initially thought it might be due to being too cold or sweating from using the air conditioner. When he goes back to the countryside, sometimes it happens and sometimes it doesn't. This year in Guangdong, the weather has been hot and he uses the air conditioner, and besides the nasal discharge, he also sneezes. I suspect it might be allergic rhinitis or rhinitis. We live in the city and there is a lot of dust in our home, I often clean the dust on the bed and the air conditioner is also cleaned regularly. But as soon as the child touches the bed to sleep, the problem comes back. The symptoms last throughout the day. I'd like to ask, is this a rhinitis issue?

Patient: The baby, a 7-month-old girl, is breastfed and has been given rice cereal. Due to the cold and unstable weather in Hunan on February 14, she may have caught a cold and developed diarrhea. The frequency of diarrhea increased, and the stool turned green and watery. After consulting a doctor, medication was prescribed, including rhubarb powder, spinosad granules, bifidobacterium triple live bacteria, and angelica ginger plaster. Despite taking the medication for a few days, there was no improvement. Later, she returned to Zhanjiang and underwent a stool examination, and another doctor prescribed rhubarb powder, rhizome protein yeast powder, bifidobacterium quadruple live bacteria, and midium. In the middle, the stool became dry for a few days, but the frequency remained over 10 times a day. Later, another doctor was consulted, suspecting that the diarrhea triggered lactose intolerance, and lactose-containing baby powder and lactase enzyme were purchased. The mother continued breastfeeding and gave her the prescribed medication, but the stool color remained yellow, and she had 10-odd bowel movements a day. There would be a little stool with each fart, and sometimes she would have stomach pain and cry. After eating rice cereal, the stool would thicken a bit, but then would become watery again. From the onset of diarrhea to now, it has been half a month. The local doctor was unable to find a solution, and we were advised to continue nourishing her. The baby's physical condition is good, without signs of dehydration, no vomiting, no red buttocks, and appetite is not as good as before. The stool is always wet and watery, or slightly thick and yellow, with some indigestible particles.

Patient: Doctor, my daughter is 3 and a half years old. She has been coughing for almost half a year, and I have taken her to the hospital many times and had chest X-rays done, but they all said there was nothing serious. The diagnosis was allergic cough, and some said it was bronchiolitis. She coughs most of the time at night while sleeping. When it's severe, she coughs very hard and has a big wheezing sound. She has had a few high fevers, but the doctor said it's not related to the cough, it's just a cold. When it's severe, I take her to the hospital, and the doctor always prescribes some medicine and does a bronchodilator treatment for 2-3 days. She has been like this for a long time, and I've never stopped the medication. She's still not cured, and I'm totally worried. I hope you can provide a comprehensive treatment plan to help solve this problem.\n	Allergic sinusitis	train

Patient: The baby is 5 months and 2 weeks old. On October 17, the baby had a cold and cough, and the doctor diagnosed with bronchitis. During treatment, the baby had diarrhea, and a stool test showed 3-5 white cells. The doctor prescribed antibiotics, but there was no effect. The baby stopped taking the antibiotics and only ate "Mommy Love" formula. The cough improved on October 31, but the diarrhea turned into yellow and watery stools. On November 3, the baby had a cold with clear nasal discharge. The baby started coughing on November 6, and had 2-3 coughs at night, and 3-4 coughs in the morning. The baby also had night sweats on the back of the head. The baby had diarrhea with yellow and watery stools, and would have a bowel movement every time after drinking breast milk, 3-5 times a day. On November 7, the doctor diagnosed with acute bronchitis and prescribed "Easytan" and "Oseltamivir" powder. On the same day, the baby saw another doctor who diagnosed with common cold. On November 8, the baby saw another doctor for a check-up, and the doctor heard a sound when listening to the chest, so a sputum test was done. Medication: On November 7, the baby took "Oseltamivir" powder and lactobacillus in the evening. On November 8, the baby took "Oseltamivir" powder in the morning and did a sputum test. The picture shows the medication prescribed by the doctor and the baby's stool condition for the past two days. Which of these medications are suitable for the baby to take? I searched the information of the medication used for sputum test, but it doesn't seem to be used for treating phlegm.
